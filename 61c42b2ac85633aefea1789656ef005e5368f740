      "message": "Can you elaborate on why you think the postgres engine doesn\u0027t have this problem?\n\nThe problem it is intended to solve is to avoiding executing a whole SQL query if we know that the cache key is definitely not contained in the DB. For a postgres backend, a negative result from the bloom filter would avoid sending a whole query over the wire, so if anything that seems like *more* of a benefit than when the SQL query is just executed in the local Java process.",

But there is still a benefit, it\u0027s just a question of whether the cost outweighs the benefit, which is something that I think should be decided with data.
